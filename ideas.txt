a few special rounds:
  don't score = lowest score wins
  no touching = touching other players kills both of you
  fov experience = 135 fov for all
  x2 boss battle
  last is best = ?
  super speed?

microgames:
  enter a door maybe (one door is deadly?)
  avoid the bombs (fall from sky - maybe add deflector?)
  reach the end:
    short map with obstacles, people get in karts
    run up a hill with deadly balls rolling down
    ramp map that you boost up, people in karts, moving obstacles to fly past?
  maybe some classics:
    get on a platform
    (x) break a barrel done
    type the word/color (misleading color/word combination)
    (x) avoid the kamikaze done
  hit the target (one vehicle flies in distance, gotta hit with a shot)
  small arena with spikes everywhere + everyone has deflectors, survive
  (boss) some adaptation of "avoid the cuddly heavy" would be awesome
  (boss) rocket dodgeball
  (boss) hexagon heat
  (boss) paint wars:
    players have to paint as much of arena as possible
  (boss) western shootout:
    players are put in pairs in front of each other, have to shoot on "GO!".
  goomba stomp a player (jump on their head)
    how to do this in a good way?
    everybody would be moving so itd be hard
    perhaps higher jump height?

respawn everyone and give winner(s) weapon on end
rename math microgame to "type the answer in chat"
show a short top 3 + your own score in bottomprint
make "hit an enemy" let you win if you died but hit somebody
