a few special rounds:
  don't score = lowest score wins
  no touching = touching other players kills both of you
  fov experience = 135 fov for all
  x2 boss battle
  last is best = ?
  super speed?

microgames:
  enter a door maybe (one door is deadly?)
  avoid the bombs (fall from sky - maybe add deflector?)
  reach the end:
    short map with obstacles, people get in karts
    run up a hill with deadly balls rolling down
    ramp map that you boost up, people in karts, moving obstacles to fly past?
  maybe some classics:
    get on a platform
    break a barrel
    type the word/color (misleading color/word combination)
    avoid the kamikaze?
  hit the target (one vehicle flies in distance, gotta hit with a shot)
  small arena with spikes everywhere + everyone has deflectors, survive
  (boss) some adaptation of "avoid the cuddly heavy" would be awesome
  (boss) rocket dodgeball
  (boss) hexagon heat
  goomba stomp a player (jump on their head)
    how to do this in a good way?
    everybody would be moving so itd be hard

respawn everyone and give winner(s) weapon on end
rename math microgame to "type the answer in chat"
show a short top 3 + your own score in bottomprint
make "hit an enemy" let you win if you died but hit somebody
